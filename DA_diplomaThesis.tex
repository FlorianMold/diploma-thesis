Assignment of tasks & Target of the diploma thesis is that supplier can register with their suppliernumber. Afterwards they wait until the Accounting unlocks their account. After that they supplier can login into the platform and start to upload bills. Additionally to the bill the supplier has to specify metadatas. They describe the bill in detail (e.g.: suppliernumber, amount, ...). After the bill was uploaded it can be seen by an accounter. Thereupon the accounter can fetch the bill. This means that the bill in PDF-format together with the metadatas in an XML-Document are sent with e-mail to the automatic accounting management. & \\
